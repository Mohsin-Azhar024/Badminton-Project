					Grip (badminton) ,In badminton, a grip is a way of holding the racket in order to hit shots during a
					match. ... Most players change grips during a rally depending on whether it is a forehand or
					backhand shot. A grip is also the wrapping around the handle of the racket.

			Shuttlecocks

		<div class="two_things">

				<p>
					A shuttlecock is a high-drag projectile used in the sport of badminton. It has an open conical shape
					formed by feathers or alternatives embedded into a rounded cork (or rubber) base. The shuttlecock's
					shape makes it extremely aerodynamically stable.

				<P>
					Badminton shoes are lightweight with soles of rubber or similar high-grip, non-marking materials.
					Compared to running shoes, badminton shoes have little lateral support.
					High levels of lateral support are useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and
					unexpected.

			How to Serve
		</h1>


		<div class="two_things">
			<div class="first">
				<p>
					In badminton, the serve must be hit in an upwards direction, with an underarm hitting action. You
					are not allowed to play a tennis style serve.<br>
					The main rule here is that when you hit the shuttle, it must be below your waist. To be exact, the
					rules define this to be a height level with the lowest part of your ribcage.

			<div class="first">
				<P>
					Badminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of skill to
					perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either forehand or backhand. A player's
					forehand side is the same side as their playing hand: for a right-handed player, the forehand side
					is their right side and the backhand side is their left side and for a left-handed
					player ,it is reversed.

		<h1 class="first_heading">
			Shadow Badminton (Footwork)
		</h1>

		<p class="para">
			This is to practice the correct movement and technique without actually hitting a shuttle. Get a partner to
			help direct you to the areas of the court, making sure that you cover the backcourt, midcourt, and the
			frontcourt with both your forehand and backhand.<br><br>

			Commit fully during this practice as you would in any competition. Imagine that you are playing against a
			world class player. It will definitely improve your movement on court and fitness.

		<h1 class="first_heading">
			Wall Rally Drill
		</h1>

		<p class="para">
			Take an old shuttle and hit it against the wall. Hit the shuttle with your forehand and backhand, straight
			or diagonal. It can be used for practicing almost every stroke. It is a good way to improve footwork,
			strengthen the arm and wrist muscles used in badminton.<br><br>

			The wall should be at least 20 feet high to accommodate clears. The practice will be more effective if you
			can show the height of the net with a chalk line or a string, 5 feet above the ground.<br><br>

			As the shuttle rebounds so fast from the wall, your wrist will naturally come into play. You will learn how
			to switch grips at an instance as well. You will be amazed on your improved reflexes the next time you step
			on court.
			Hitting a shuttle against a wall is an effective practice at all levels of plays.

		</p>

		<h1 class="first_heading">
			Multiple Shuttles - Overhead Strokes
		</h1>

		<p class="para">
			The more shuttles you have, the better for this routine. The feeder plays the shuttles into different areas
			of your backcourt. You will then use your forehand, backhand or around the head to play the clears, drop
			shots or smashes. Return to your base position after each shot.<br><br>

			This badminton drill is meant to improve your speed and accuracy in executing overhead strokes. You have to
			remember that merely reaching the shuttles is not enough. You have to play quality shots to the other side.

		<h1 class="first_heading">
			Multiple shuttles - Net Play
		</h1>


		<p class="para">
			Again, you will need a lot of shuttles for this routine. The feeder throws the shuttles to your net area.
			You will then decide whether to play a net shot, a net kill or a net lift with your forehand or backhand.
			Return to your base position after each shot.<br><br>
			This badminton drill is meant to improve your net play and your movement on court. The quality of your
			return is important. Pay attention to it or this practice will not be effective.

			Half Court Singles
		</h1>

		<p class="para">
			Playing half court singles can improve footwork and increase stamina. It will train you to play more
			accurate shots with all strokes as well. It is fun to play and effective in improving your game.
		</p>

		<h1 class="first_heading">
			King of the Court
		</h1>

		<p class="para">
			This game is useful when you are with a lot of players. It is enjoyable and can improve your overall game.
			It is played with the normal rules and regulation. You can set the winning condition, normally whoever
			reaches 3 points first wins.<br><br>

			The winner will stay in the court as king while another player will take him on. The king will stay on until
			he looses. The eventual winner of that duel will then switch to the other side of the court becoming king.

		<h1 class="first_heading">
			2 Versus 1
		</h1>

		<p class="para">
			If you want to improve your singles play, this is a badminton drill that you can't do without. It is played
			on a singles court and is great for improving fitness, speed around the court, footwork and shot
			accuracy.<br><br>

			The two players on one side of the court must assume a front back position and play as they would in a
			singles match. You will then be able to play in a very tough and pressured condition, enabling you to raise
			your game.
			<br><br>

			World class players put in a lot of effort during their Badminton Training. If you aspire to be one, you
			should do that too. Practice in the above Badminton Drills and I am sure you will come off a better player.
