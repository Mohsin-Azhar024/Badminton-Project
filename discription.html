		<p class="paras">
			Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia, but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the British as a variant of the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock ("Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".) Its exact origin remains obscure. The name derives from the Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House in Gloucestershire, but why or when remains unclear. As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published a booklet entitled Badminton Battledore – A New Game, but no copy is known to have survived. An 1863 article in The Cornhill Magazine describes badminton as "battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground"	<br><br>

			The game may have originally developed among expatriate officers in British India, where it was very popular by the 1870s. Ball badminton, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being played in Thanjavur as early as the 1850s and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.<br><br>

			Early on, the game was also known as Poona or Poonah after the garrison town of Poona , where it was particularly popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in 1873.By 1875, officers returning home had started a badminton club in Folkestone. Initially, the sport was played with sides ranging from 1 to 4 players, but it was quickly established that games between two or four competitors worked the best.The shuttlecocks were coated with India rubber and, in outdoor play, sometimes weighted with lead. Although the depth of the net was of no consequence, it was preferred that it should reach the ground.

		The sport was played under the Pune rules until 1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the Bath Badminton Club drew up revised regulations.In 1890, Hart and Bagnel Wild again revised the rules.The Badminton Association of England (BAE) published these rules in 1893 and officially launched the sport at a house called "Dunbar"in Portsmouth on 13 September.The BAE started the first badminton competition, the All England Open Badminton Championships for gentlemen's doubles, ladies' doubles, and mixed doubles, in 1899.Singles competitions were added in 1900 and an England–Ireland championship match appeared in 1904.<br><br>

		England, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand were the founding members of the International Badminton Federation in 1934, now known as the Badminton World Federation. India joined as an affiliate in 1936. The BWF now governs international badminton. Although initiated in England, competitive men's badminton has traditionally been dominated in Europe by Denmark. Worldwide, Asian nations have become dominant in international competition. China, Denmark, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea are the nations which have consistently produced world-class players in the past few decades, with China being the greatest force in men's and women's competition recently.
		The game has also become a popular backyard sport in the United States.

			Court Information
		</h2>

		<p class="paras">
			The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only.The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of the same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.<br><br>

			The full width of the court is 6.1 metres (20 ft), and in singles this width is reduced to 5.18 metres (17 ft). The full length of the court is 13.4 metres (44 ft). The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98 metres (6 ft 6 inch) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76 metres (2 ft 6 inch) from the back boundary.

		<p class="paras">
			The net is 1.55 metres (5 ft 1 inch) high at the edges and 1.524 metres (5 ft) high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.
			<br><br>

			The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton. Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.

		<h2 class="second_headings"> 
			The Absolute Basics
		</h2>

		<p class="paras">
			The aim of badminton is to hit the shuttle with your racket so that it passes over the net and lands inside your opponent’s half of the court. Whenever you do this, you have won a rally; win enough rallies, and you win the match.<br><br>

			Your opponent has the same goal. He will try to reach the shuttle and send it back into your half of the court. You can also win rallies from your opponent’s mistakes: if he hits the shuttle into or under the net, or out of court, then you win the rally.<br><br>

			If you think your opponent’s shot is going to land out, then you should let it fall to the floor. If you hit the shuttle instead, then the rally continues.<br><br>


			Once the shuttle touches the ground, the rally is over. In this respect, badminton is not like tennis or squash, where the ball can bounce.<br><br>


			You must hit the shuttle once only before it goes over the net (even in doubles). In this respect, badminton is not like volleyball, where multiple players can touch the ball before sending it back over the net.<br><br>
		</p>

		<h1 class="main_headings"> 
			Badminton is played indoors
		</h1>

		<p class="paras"> 
			Some of you may be familiar with playing badminton on a beach , or in the garden. This is fine when you’re playing it as a casual game, but it doesn’t work when you start to get competitive.<br><br>

			The shuttle is blown off course by even the slightest breath of wind . That’s why competitive badminton is always played indoors.
		</p>


		<h1 class="main_headings"> 
			Setting up a badminton court
		</h1>

		<p class="paras">
			Badminton has its own nets and posts; the net is much lower than for volleyball. Sometimes a sports centre will set up the court with a slack volleyball net instead, because the staff don’t know anything about badminton. Ask for proper badminton posts and a badminton net.
		</p>


		<h2 class="black_head"> 
			If you need to set up the court yourself, then check three things:
		</h2>

		<div class="simple_para">
			<ol>
				<li>The net covers the whole width of the court.</li>
				<li>The net is pulled tight, not slack.</li>
				<li>The net is in the middle, so that both court halves are the same size.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>


		<h1 class="main_headings"> 
			Singles, doubles, and mixed doubles
		</h1>

		<p class="paras">
			You can have either two or four players on a badminton court: one player on each side, or a team of two players on each side. One-against-one is called singles; two-against-two is called doubles.<br><br>

			In doubles, either player can hit the shuttle; you do not have to take it in turns. The only exceptions are the first two shots of the rally; I’ll explain this when we discuss serving.
			<br>

		</p>

		<h2 class="black_head"> 
			In total, there are five types of badminton:
		</h2>

		<div class="simple_para">
			<ol>
				<li>Men’s singles</li>
				<li>Women’s singles</li>
				<li>Men’s doubles</li>
				<li>Women’s doubles</li>
				<li>Mixed doubles (each team is a man and a woman)</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p class="paras big">
			<b>Men’s doubles and women’s doubles are also called level doubles.<br><br>
			These are the only types of badminton played in serious tournaments. In casual play, however, women sometimes play against men (e.g. two women against two men).</b>
		</p>


		<h1 class="main_headings"> 
			All the other lines are for serving
		</h1>

		<p class="paras">
			There are still three lines we haven’t discussed yet. These lines mean nothing during the main rally, and only apply when you’re serving. This is similar to how a tennis court has special lines for serving.
		</p>



		<h1 class="main_headings"> 
			Serving
		</h1>

		<p class="paras">
			Serving is how you start the rally: someone has to hit the shuttle first! To prevent the server gaining an overwhelming advantage, there are special restrictions placed on serving that don’t apply during the rest of the rally.<br><br>

			The receiver is the person who hits the second shot in the rally. In doubles, the receiver’s partner is not allowed to hit this shot.
		</p>


		<h1 class="main_headings"> 
			How to serve
		</h1>

		<p class="paras">
			In badminton, the serve must be hit in an upwards direction, with an underarm hitting action. You are not allowed to play a tennis style serve.<br><br>
			The main rule here is that when you hit the shuttle, it must be below your waist. To be exact, the rules define this to be a height level with the lowest part of your ribcage. In other words, you can serve from a bit higher than the top of your shorts, but not much.

		<h1 class="main_headings"> 
			Service courts
		</h1>

		<p class="paras">
			The service courts are smaller box shapes inside the court. We’ll look at what they are used for in a moment, but first let’s get the right boxes.<br><br>

			Notice that the badminton court has a line down the middle, extending from the back to near the net; this is the centre line. At the front of the court, the centre line is met by another line; this is the front service line. These two lines form a T shape where they meet.
			(The service of badminton is cross)
		</p>

				 Badminton cross service for both<br>
				  the singles and doubles 
			</figcaption>
		</figure>


		<p class="paras">
			The doubles service courts are slightly different. They are wider, because they use the outside side line (remember: the doubles court is wider); and they are shorter, because they use the inside back line.<br><br>
			That’s what the inside back line is for: doubles service, and nothing else. It’s probably the most confusing line on a badminton court, because that’s all it does!
		</p>

		<h2 class="black_head"> 
			So just to be clear, a doubles service court is made from these four lines:
		</h2>


		<div class="simple_para">
			<ol>
				<li>The centre line</li>
				<li>A doubles side line (outside side line)</li>
				<li>The front service line</li>
				<li>The inside back line (not the very back line, but the next one in)</li>
				
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h1 class="main_headings"> 
			How service courts are used
		</h1>

		<h2 class="second_headings"> 
			Service courts are used for three things:
		</h2>


		<div class="simple_para">
			<ol>
				<li>The server must stand inside a service court.</li>
				<li>The receiver must stand inside the diagonally opposite service court.</li>
				<li>The serve must travel into the diagonally opposite service court.</li>
				
			</ol>
		</div><br>


		<p class="paras">
			For example, suppose the server is standing in his left service court. The receiver will be standing in his left service court, which is also where the serve has to go
			<br><br>

			If the serve is going to land outside the service court, then the receiver should let it fall to the floor. If the receiver hits the serve, then the rally continues even if the serve had been going out.<br><br>

			The server and receiver must stay inside their service boxes until the server contacts the shuttle with his racket. After that, they can leave the boxes immediately and move anywhere on court.
		</p>


		<h1 class="main_headings"> 
			Scoring
		</h1>

		<p class="paras">
			Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served[13] (this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15 points). A match is the best of three games.<br><br>

			If the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such as 24–22), except when there is a tie at 29-all, in which the game goes to a golden point. Whoever scores this point will win.<br><br>

			If the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such as 24–22), except when there is a tie at 29-all, in which the game goes to a golden point. Whoever scores this point will win.<br><br>

			In subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. Matches are best out of three: a player or pair must win two games (of 21 points each) to win the match. For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives. The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading player's or pair's score reaches 11 points.
